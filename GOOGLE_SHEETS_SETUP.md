## Testing Your Setup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Error**: Make sure you're using `mode: 'no-cors'` in the fetch request
2. **Permission Denied**: Check that your Google Apps Script is deployed with "Anyone" access
3. **Form Not Submitting**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **Data Not Appearing**: Verify your spreadsheet ID is correct

### Debug Steps:

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for errors
3. Check the Network tab to see if requests are being sent
4. Test your Google Apps Script URL directly in the browser

## Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Google Apps Script has daily quotas
2. **Data Validation**: Always validate data on both client and server side
3. **Email Notifications**: Be careful with email notifications to avoid spam
4. **Access Control**: Consider who has access to your spreadsheet

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Response Emails
You can modify the Google Apps Script to send auto-response emails to users:

```javascript
function sendAutoResponse(data, formType) {
    const subject = formType === 'quote' 
        ? 'Thank you for your quote request' 
        : 'Thank you for contacting us';
    
    const body = `Dear ${data.name},\n\nThank you for your ${formType} request. We will get back to you within 24 hours.\n\nBest regards,\nAll India Transport Team`;
    
    MailApp.sendEmail({
        to: data.email,
        subject: subject,
        body: body
    });
}
```

### Data Analytics
You can add analytics to track form submissions:

```javascript
function logAnalytics(data, formType) {
    const analyticsSheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName('Analytics');
    if (!analyticsSheet) {
        const newSheet = spreadsheet.insertSheet('Analytics');
        newSheet.getRange(1, 1, 1, 4).setValues([['Date', 'Form Type', 'User Agent', 'IP Address']]);
    }
    
    analyticsSheet.appendRow([
        new Date(),
        formType,
        e.parameter['user-agent'] || 'Unknown',
